Talkreserve part II This is my second app for Talkreserve. This appp utilizes mandrill. I taught myself to under coffeescript, ruby, heroku, and mongolab in 5 hours, 12am - 4m. I know a little crazy!!! However I love it!!! Next step 1. add sign in 2. add update and delete 3. add mongolab database This is an attempt at learning how to create client-side apps with AngularJS as well as figuring out how to send emails without the use of a CMS or a backend that I have to deploy myself. I decided to use Mandrill for these purposes, since they give a very generous free tier (20k messages per month free!).

Shout out to headcannon! I made it actually work!
